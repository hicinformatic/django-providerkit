## Project Overview (INFORMATIONAL)

**Django ProviderKit** is a Django library that provides integration for ProviderKit. It offers Django admin integration and utilities for managing providers in Django applications.

### Core Functionality

1. **Manage providers in Django admin**:
   - Display providers in Django admin interface
   - View provider metadata and configuration
   - Manage provider settings through Django admin
   - Use virtual models to represent providers without database tables

2. **Integrate ProviderKit with Django**:
   - Use ProviderKit providers in Django applications
   - Access provider information through Django models
   - Leverage ProviderKit's provider discovery and management
   - Use ProviderKit's configuration and validation features

3. **Virtual models for providers**:
   - `ProviderModel`: Virtual model representing providers
   - `ProviderkitModel`: Model for provider kits
   - `ServiceModel`: Model for provider services
   - No database tables required (uses VirtualQuerySet)

---

## Architecture (REQUIRED)

- Django integration for ProviderKit
- Uses `VirtualModel` from django-virtualqueryset to represent providers
- Provides Django admin integration for provider management
- Maps ProviderKit's field definitions to Django model fields
- Uses ProviderKit's field descriptions and metadata
- Provider discovery and management is handled by ProviderKit

```

### Key Directories

- `src/djproviderkit/models/`: Django model definitions
- `src/djproviderkit/managers/`: Custom managers for providers
- `src/djproviderkit/admin/`: Django admin configuration
- `tests/`: All tests using pytest

---

## Command Execution (ABSOLUTE)

- **Always use**: `./service.py dev <command>` or `python dev.py <command>`
- **Always use**: `./service.py quality <command>` or `python quality.py <command>`
- Never execute commands directly without going through these entry points

---

## Code Standards (REQUIRED)

### Typing and Documentation

- All public functions and methods **must** have complete type hints
- Use **Google-style docstrings** for:
  - Public classes
  - Public methods
  - Public functions
- Document raised exceptions in docstrings where relevant

### Testing

- Use **pytest** exclusively
- All tests must live in the `tests/` directory
- New features and bug fixes require corresponding tests

### Linting and Formatting

- Follow **PEP 8**
- Use configured tools:
  - `ruff`
  - `mypy`
- Use the configured formatter:
  - `ruff format`

---

## Code Quality Principles (REQUIRED)

- **Simplicity first**: Write the simplest possible solution. Avoid complexity unless clearly necessary.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Minimize dependencies to the absolute minimum. Only add when essential functionality cannot be reasonably implemented otherwise. Always prefer standard library.
- **No over-engineering**: Do not add abstractions, patterns, or layers unless they solve a real problem or are clearly needed.
- **Comments**: Comments are minimal and only when they resolve ambiguity or uncertainty. Do not comment what the code already states clearly. Do not add comments that reiterate obvious logic.
- **Separation of concerns**: One responsibility per module
- **Good factorization**: Factorize code when it improves clarity and reduces duplication, but only if it doesn't add unnecessary complexity

---

## Module Organization (REQUIRED)

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Clear public API via `__init__.py`
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Provider-based architecture: Keep providers in separate files

---

## ProviderKit Integration (ABSOLUTE)

- `providerkit` is an installed package
- Always use standard Python imports:
  - `from providerkit import ProviderBase`
  - `from providerkit.helpers import get_providers, try_providers`
- Never manipulate import paths
- Never use file-based or relative imports to access `providerkit`
- For dynamic imports, use:
  - `importlib.import_module()` from the standard library

---

## Qualitybase Integration (ABSOLUTE)

- `qualitybase` is an installed package (used via service.py)
- Always use standard Python imports from `qualitybase.services` when needed
- No path manipulation: Never manipulate `sys.path` or use file paths to import qualitybase modules
- Direct imports only: Use `from qualitybase.services import ...` or `import qualitybase.services ...`
- Standard library imports: Use `importlib.import_module()` from the standard library if needed for dynamic imports
- Works everywhere: Since qualitybase is installed in the virtual environment, imports work consistently across all projects

---

## Model Development (REQUIRED)

### Creating Provider Models

Provider models use VirtualModel from django-virtualqueryset:

```python
from djproviderkit.models import ProviderModel

class MyProviderModel(ProviderModel):
    class Meta:
        managed = False
        verbose_name = "My Provider"
```

### Required Meta Options

- `managed = False`: All virtual models must have this
- Models inherit from `ProviderModel` or `ServiceModel`
- Field definitions come from ProviderKit's field metadata

### ProviderKit Integration

- Uses ProviderKit's field definitions (`FIELDS_PROVIDER_BASE`, `FIELDS_CONFIG_BASE`, etc.)
- Maps ProviderKit fields to Django model fields via `fields_associations`
- Provides Django admin interface for ProviderKit providers

---

## Environment Variables (REQUIRED)

- `ENVFILE_PATH`
  - Path to `.env` file to load automatically
  - Relative to project root if not absolute
- `ENSURE_VIRTUALENV`
  - Set to `1` to automatically activate `.venv` if it exists
- Provider-specific variables:
  - Use provider-specific prefixes (e.g., `NOMINATIM_`, `GOOGLE_MAPS_`, `MAPBOX_`, etc.)
  - Never hardcode API keys in code

---

## Error Handling (REQUIRED)

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Use appropriate exception types
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Do not swallow exceptions silently
- Document exceptions in docstrings where relevant
- Handle API rate limits and failures with proper retry logic when appropriate
- Support provider fallback mechanisms for resilience

---

## Configuration and Secrets (ABSOLUTE)

- Never hardcode:
  - API keys
  - Credentials
  - Tokens
  - Secrets
- Use environment variables or configuration files
- Use provider-specific configuration prefixes
- Clearly document required configuration

---

## Versioning (REQUIRED)

- Follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
- Update versions appropriately
- Clearly document breaking changes

---

## CLI System (INFORMATIONAL)

Django ProviderKit uses qualitybase's service system:

- Services accessed via `./service.py <service> <command>`
- Available services: `dev`, `quality`, `django`, `publish`

---

## Anti-Hallucination Clause (ABSOLUTE)

If a requested change is:
- Not supported by this document
- Not clearly aligned with the existing codebase
- Requiring assumptions or invention

You must:
1. Stop
2. Explain what is unclear or conflicting
3. Ask for clarification

Do not guess. Do not invent.
